  <h3>Design Neural Networks with a Simple Sketch</h3>
</div>

Sketch NN is a powerful tool that allows you to design and generate PyTorch neural network code from simple flowchart sketches. With Sketch NN, you can quickly prototype complex neural architectures without writing a single line of code!

## 🌟 Features

- 📸 Upload or capture flowchart images
- 🧠 Supports a wide range of neural network layers
- 🔧 Generates ready-to-use PyTorch code
- 🖥️ User-friendly Gradio web interface
- 🚀 FastAPI backend for scalable deployment

## 🛠️ Supported Layers

- Convolutional (Conv2D)
- Pooling (MaxPool2D, AvgPool2D)
- Fully Connected (Linear)
- Batch Normalization
- Dropout
- Activation Functions (ReLU, LeakyReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Recurrent (LSTM, GRU)
- Transformer
- Multi-head Attention

## 🖼️ How It Works

[Insert a diagram or flowchart here showing the process from sketch to code]

1. Sketch your neural network architecture
2. Upload or capture the image
3. Sketch NN processes the image and extracts layer information
4. PyTorch code is generated based on the extracted information
5. Download and use the generated code in your project
